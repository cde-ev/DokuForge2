== soon and important ==
* rcs is much stricter about usernames as df2 creating error potential
  --> merge branch by stefan to give web access to admin rcs history
  --> enforce the three following conditions for changes:
        * must be python parseable
        * all names must consist of [a-z0-9-]
        * at minimum one superadmin must remain
      otherwise save the changes in a branch and inform the user

== not so important ==
* view content of whole course on one page (df1 feature)
  this becomes more interesting when read-only links are sent to participants
