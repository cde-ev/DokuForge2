== soon and important ==
* rcs is much stricter about usernames as df2 creating error potential
  --> merge branch by stefan to give web access to admin rcs history
  --> enforce the three following conditions for changes:
        * must be python parseable
        * all names must consist of [a-z0-9-]
        * at minimum one superadmin must remain
      otherwise save the changes in a branch and inform the user

== not so important ==
* view content of whole course on one page (df1 feature)
  this becomes more interesting when read-only links are sent to participants
* list of all blobs (so the Fuzzi can review for bad quality/missing raw data)
  an export seems to be more useful to quickly review many blobs
* redirect POST-request such that reloading (F5) is possible
  both Firefox and Chromium warn the user before resending a post request
  when resending anyway, only a trivial conflict is created to be saved again
