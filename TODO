== soon and important ==
* add documentation
* /docs/$aca/$course/32746238764273846 creates rcs files
  * you can even edit these pages
  * you can relink them
  * they pop up when "creating a new page"
  * similar problem for blobs

== later and important ==
* exporter
* bibliography: serialize as json

== not so important ==
* nicer design
* upgraded navigation (back-buttons, all sort of cross-links, action links at the top _and_ at the bottom)
* show some stuff only if relevant (list of blobs, links to deleted stuff, ...)
* make buttons look like other links or vice versa
* add functionality to insert parts before/after the current part, when viewing a certain part
* link directly to headings (with anchors) and not only to the page in general on the page listing for a course
* add links to edit/delete pages directly from the course page listing
* add some more context information for easing the navigation for the user
* nicer admin interface
* tweaked print.css
* webaccess to rcs history
* per course trail export (to view the current length)
* interactive page swapping
* create manual for setting up a local dokuforge server
* escaping in ednotes in exportparser
* sensible file types for downloads
* "wrong password" needs html rendering
* extremely long course titles break layout
* preview and edit (df1 feature)
* view content of whole course on one page (df1 feature)
* list of all blobs (so the Fuzzi can review for bad quality/missing raw data)
* exporter: fix usage of \@
* exporter: fix 'komma~-- ' and ' --~brackets~-- ' and '3--7'
* exporter: fix utf8-handling
* exporter: fix spacing after numerations ('21.\,Jahrhundert')
* exporter: fix spacing before units ('200\,m' and '30\,kV')
* exporter: fix spacing around special characters (e.g. %)
* exporter: fix spacing around \dots ('it was~\dots{}')
* exporter: mangle course and academy titles as well as captions (currently they are simply copy pasted, but we want to e.g. replace '...' by '\dots')
* exporter: in $x_1,...,x_n$ the dots are not replaced by \dots{}
* add course number attribute (so each course knows which number it has for export)
* evaluate estimator performance (how acurate is the estimate, does it need tuning?)
* check and fix bugs reported via meta academy
* fix groups support
* update style guide -- add more information about conflicts and a short resolution howto
