* make buttons look like other links or vice versa

* add links to edit/delete pages directly from the course page listing
* add some more context information for easing the navigation for the user
* nicer admin interface
* tweaked print.css
* webaccess to rcs history
* trail export (to view the current length)
* interactive page swapping
* create manual for setting up a local dokuforge server
* sensible file types for downloads
* "wrong password" needs html rendering
* extremely long course titles break layout
* create batch task form (creating an academy and all courses with one form)
* set LC_ALL=C when calling rcs (fixed in branch last-edited)
* preview and edit (df1 feature)
* view content of whole course on one page (df1 feature)
* list of all blobs (so the Fuzzi can review for bad quality/missing raw data)
