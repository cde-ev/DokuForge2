    Abstract class where all line-groups inherit from.

    A line group is a group of sucessive lines forming a logical
    unit, like a paragraph, an item in an enumeration, etc.

    Within a line group, further parsing is carried out for more
    fine granular markup, like emphazising words, math-mode, etc.

    Linegroups can then be grouped together, if desired. E.g. successive
    item-entries cann be grouped to an itemization environment, thus
    yielding a parse tree of the whole dokument.
